## Description
My cafe-themed shop's website has three main screens: Home, Menu, and Contact. The Home screen introduces new and popular items, the Menu screen showcases the delicious offerings, and the Contact screen has the contact information. The website features cafe's signature colors and imagery throughout. All credit are in the page not copyright intended.
